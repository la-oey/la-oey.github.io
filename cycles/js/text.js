See, happiness matters very much to God, so I have been focused on making beings happier for some time now. Independent of my designs, humans have found a way to lengthen the human life span and reproduce exponentially. This has caused higher consumption of all other finite resources, which is worse off for the universe as a whole. And so, the optimal solution seems to be to iteratively halve the human population in each successive generation until we decide that humans can repopulate again. I see the look of concern on your face.</td></tr></table>',

I do not mean I shall reduce the population through nefarious means, such as weapons of mass destruction or virulent pandemics. Rather, we want to maximize all individual happiness as well. As you’ll see, I came up with a solution in which everyone can be happy. Once the human population reached 2<sup>34</sup>, I temporarily paused all human sexual reproduction and tremendously slowed aging. It’s been about 160 human years now of minimal population change. In this time, I have been seeking the optimal solution to human romantic coupling—well, there are many who prefer to have multiple partnerships, and I have taken their happiness into account as well. See, partnering up every human with at least one other human (depending on their preferences for number of partners and sexual and romantic orientation) is computationally exceedingly difficult, let alone trying to find each individual’s optimal partner(s). To give you an idea of the scope, if every individual were monogamous and bisexual or pansexual, the number of arrangements of couples would be:</td></tr></table>',
